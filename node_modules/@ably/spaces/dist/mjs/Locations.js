 * The member location feature enables you to track where members are within a space, to see which part of your application they’re interacting with. A location could be the form field they have selected, the cell they’re currently editing in a spreadsheet, or the slide they’re viewing within a slide deck. Multiple members can be present in the same location.
 *
 * Member locations are used to visually display which component other members currently have selected, or are currently active on. Events are emitted whenever a member sets their location, such as when they click on a new cell, or slide. Events are received by members subscribed to location events and the UI component can be highlighted with the active member’s profile data to visually display their location.

 * ## Member location foundations
 *
 * The Spaces SDK is built upon existing Ably functionality available in Ably’s Core SDKs. Understanding which core features are used to provide the abstractions in the Spaces SDK enables you to manage space state and build additional functionality into your application.
 *
 * Member locations build upon the functionality of the Pub/Sub Channels [presence](https://ably.com/docs/presence-occupancy/presence) feature. Members are entered into the presence set when they {@link Space.enter | enter the space}.
 *

     * Use the `set()` method to emit a location event in realtime when a member changes their location. This will be received by all location subscribers to inform them of the location change. A `location` can be any JSON-serializable object, such as a slide number or element ID.
     *
     * A member must have been { @link Space.enter | entered } into the space to set their location.
     *
     * The `set()` method is commonly combined with [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) or a React [synthetic event](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events#adding-event-handlers), such as `onClick` or `onHover`.
